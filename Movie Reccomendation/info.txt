Movie Recommendation System - Info.txt
======================================

App Description:
----------------
This is a **Movie Recommendation System** that uses content-based filtering to recommend similar movies based on the title you provide. 
It analyzes the genre and overview of a movie and finds the top 5 most similar movies using **cosine similarity**.

Features:
---------
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the similarity of genre and movie overview.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between movies based on their tags (genre + overview).
- **User-Friendly UI**: Built with **Streamlit** for an interactive, easy-to-use interface.

How to Use:
------------
1. **Enter a Movie Title**: Type in the title of any movie you want to find recommendations for.
2. **Get Recommendations**: Based on the movie you input, the system will suggest the top 5 similar movies.
3. **Enjoy**: Get inspired and find new movies to watch! üçø

Installation Instructions:

   - **pandas**: `pip install pandas`
   - **numpy**: `pip install numpy`
   - **sklearn**: `pip install scikit-learn`
   - **streamlit**: `pip install streamlit`

2. Download or clone the repository containing this app and the `dataset.csv` file.

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   - Open the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the app, and type:

Acknowledgments:
----------------
- This recommendation system uses **cosine similarity** from the `sklearn` library to find similar movies.
- The **CountVectorizer** from `sklearn` is used to transform the text data (movie genres and overviews) into a feature matrix.
